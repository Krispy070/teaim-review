I see what’s happening, Kris. Your Drizzle bootstrap + seed is working — the Seed Response shows non-zero counts:

"inserted": {
  "areas": 2,
  "workbooks": 2,
  "reports": 2,
  "changes": 2,
  "comments": 2,
  "releases": 1,
  "notifications": 1,
  "signoffs": 1
}


✅ That means the tables exist and rows are being created correctly.

❌ But the Staging Test Runner panel is still red on Digest, Area ZIP, Notifications, Releases. That’s because the runner UI is not reading from your new seed output — it’s still wired to the old “0 inserts” object. In other words: backend fixed, frontend panel stale.

How to clear the last reds
1. Confirm the runner fetches the v2 endpoint

Open ui/pages/AdminTestRunner.tsx (or wherever Seed & Run lives):

async function seedAndRun(projectId: string) {
  const res = await fetch("/admin/test/seed-v2", {   // <-- must be seed-v2
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ projectId })
  });
  const json = await res.json();
  console.log("Seed response:", json);               // should show seeder:"v2"
  setSeedLog(JSON.stringify(json, null, 2));         // panel should render these counts
  await runAllTests(projectId);
}


👉 If you see seeder:"v2" in DevTools but the panel still shows the old stringified object, update the setSeedLog call to render the json directly, not an old state variable.

2. Update the Test Runner panel

Right now it looks like the panel is still bound to:

{"ok":true,"inserted":{"workbooks":"0",...}}


Replace that with the v2 object:

<pre className="seed-output">
  {seedLog}
</pre>


…and ensure seedLog is being set from the v2 JSON above.

3. Why the tests fail even with rows

The test checks call APIs like /digest/preview, /area/export, /notifications, /releases.

If those APIs return empty, it’s because they’re reading from project context that isn’t using the new data.

Fix is simple: seed with projectId (you already do), then make sure the runner passes that same projectId into its tests.

Next steps

Open DevTools → Network when you click Seed & Run.

Check the POST URL (must be /admin/test/seed-v2).

Check the response body (must include seeder:"v2" and non-zero counts).

If ✅, then update AdminTestRunner.tsx so the panel prints that JSON.
Right now it’s logging the old format.

Re-run. You should see:

7/8 green (invalid token negative stays red).
